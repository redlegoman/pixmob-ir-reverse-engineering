# running one of the PixMob_Transmitter sketches in the arduino_sender folder. Note that it may take two or more tries
# to make bracelets react after they have been inactive for a while.

# Set the ALL_CAPS parameters below and run the script. Also set ARDUINO_SERIAL_PORT and
# ARDUINO_BAUD_RATE in python_tools/config.py

# Which effect/color to display on the lights. See base_color_effects or special_effects in effect_definitions.py for
# options.

# Optional, set to None if not using. Can use this to modify simple color effects by making them fade in and/or out
# and/or making them display probabilistically. See tail_codes in effect_definitions.py for options.
# WARNING: NOT ALL TAIL CODES ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL BRACELETS AND COLORS. It may take some trial and error.
